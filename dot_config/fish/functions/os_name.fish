# Detect the current OS in a simplified, one-word format.
# Returns: linux | macos | wsl2 | msys2 | cygwin | unknown
#
# Implementation note:
# Normally, one might use `uname -s` or `uname -r` for OS detection.
# However, on MSYS2/WSL these external commands are relatively expensive
# (each call involves a slow process fork/exec).
# Since this function is called frequently from conf.d and other scripts,
# we rely on environment variables (MSYSTEM, CYGWIN, WSL_DISTRO_NAME, OSTYPE)
# that are already set by the runtime environment.
# This avoids repeated external command calls and keeps startup fast.
