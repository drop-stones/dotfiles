# Ripgrep (rg) config file

# Search hidden files by default. This is useful because we typically do want to
# search dotfiles and directories like .github
--hidden

# A special case is the .git directory. We rarely want to search it. If we do
# want to search it with this setting in place we can just cd inside .git and
# repeat the search.

# Because who cares about case!?
--smart-case
